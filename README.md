# DermaNet
DermaNet is a deep learning model that predicts age and gender from skin images. It preprocesses images with techniques like grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and CLAHE to enhance quality. The model then uses a CNN to extract features, providing accurate predictions for applications in health and skincare.
